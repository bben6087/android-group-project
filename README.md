## Describe the problem/issue your app is going to address.

With this app we hope to provide students a way to set up study sessions with fellow classmates, aslo provide them a way to see other students in the same class as them, hopfully it would encourage more students to group study and inturn learn the subject better.


## The app will have
Messaging: users can message other students in thier calss in order to set up study sessions 

An Events page showing the (Time-Date_Location_Description) this will aslo be where students schedule study sessions with other students 

And the calender page will display what clases you are in as well as letting others to see what classes you are in.


## Risky Components 

Database - there is some diffficulty with the amount of data we have to handle

Calendar - We are unsure on how to implent this yet 

Messaging - It would be difficult to create because we are unsure how to and it would require the use of an API
